[general]
Hello user!
this is a simple console app where you can play chess. It includes the option to add custom pieces and play against an AI.
available commands: piece, fen, reset, takeback, toggleBlackBot, toggleWhiteBot, help.
type help <command> to see info about that command.
default behaviour (with no command) is to make a move.

[move]
you make a move by typing the starting square and the target square, for examlpe e2e4 as the first move.

[piece]
create a custom piece
expects a piece identifier, at most one optional argument and a move description.

optional arguments are: 
- mirror <xy>: the piece movement is mirrored along the Y and/or X axis
example: piece b mirror xy 11>22>33>44>55>66>77
- symmetric: the piece can also move rotated by 90, 180 or 270 degrees
example: piece n symmetric 12,21
- combine: doesn't expect a usual move desription, but rather a list of pieces that the new piece combines
example: piece q combine r,b

move description:
it is a chain of positions, "," and ">". A move description of "11" means the piece can move up and right diagonally by 1 square.
"11, -1-1, 1-1, -11" means it can move diagonally by 1 in any direction, and "11>22" means it can move diagonally by (1,1) and if
that square is clear, can continue to (2,2).
bracketing is possible, for example "piece x symmetric 11>(21,12)" is a possible implementation of a knight that doesn't jump.
however, making a bracket the condition for another move is not supported, such as "(10,01)>11".


[fen]
without arguments, prints the fen of the current position.
with an argument, it attempts to load a given FEN.
keep in mind that castling and en passant is not supported, so those fields will be blank in the generated FEN and ignored in the loaded one.

[reset]
loads the default board position.

[takeback]
unmakes the last full move.

[toggleBlackBot]
toggles whether black is played by a bot, default true.

[toggleWhiteBot]
toggles whether white is played by a bot, default false.

[help]
without arguments, displays the entire help file.
with an argument, attempts to find the help category for a givevn command.
