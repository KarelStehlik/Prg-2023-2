[general]
Hello user!
In this simple console app. you can play chess, optionally with custom pieces and/or against an AI.
The game is played until king capture.
Available commands: piece, fen, reset, takeback, toggleBlackBot, toggleWhiteBot, help.
Type help <command> to see info about that command.
Default behaviour (with no command) is to make a move.

[move]
You make a move by typing the starting square and the target square, for example e2e4 as the first move.

[piece]
Create a custom piece
Expects a piece identifier, at most one optional argument and a move description.

optional arguments are:
- mirror <xy>: the piece movement is mirrored along the Y and/or X axis
Example, bishop: piece b mirror xy 11>22>33>44>55>66>77
- symmetric: the piece can also move rotated by 90, 180 or 270 degrees
Example, knight: piece n symmetric 12,21
- combine: doesn't expect a usual move description, but rather a list of pieces that the new piece combines
Example, queen: piece q combine r,b

move description:
Consists of a chain of positions, "," and ">". A move description of "11" means the piece can move up and right diagonally by 1 square.
"11, -1-1, 1-1, -11" means it can move diagonally by 1 in any direction, and "11>22" means it can move diagonally by (1,1) and if that square is clear, can continue to (2,2).
Bracketing is possible, for example "piece x symmetric 11>(21,12)" is a possible implementation of a knight that doesn't jump. however, making a bracket the condition for another move is not supported, such as "(10,01)>11".

Any position may have a series of tags after it:
c - must capture with this move
n - cannot capture with this move
=X - promotes to X if landing on the last rank. X must exist as a piece when using this tag, and later overwriting X will change the piece this promotes to. 
f - this can only be the first move with a piece


[fen]
Without arguments, prints the fen of the current position.
With an argument, attempts to load a given FEN.
Castling and en passant is not supported, so those fields will be blank in the generated FEN and ignored in the loaded one.

[reset]
Loads the default board position. Keeps any piece definitions. Equivalent to "fen rnbqkbnr/pppppppp/8/8/8/8/PPPPPPPP/RNBQKBNR w - - 0 0"

[takeback]
Unmakes the last full move.

[toggleBlackBot]
Toggles whether black (red) is played by a bot, default true.

[toggleWhiteBot]
Toggles whether white (green) is played by a bot, default false.

[help]
Without arguments, displays the entire help file.
With an argument, attempts to find the help category for a givevn term.
